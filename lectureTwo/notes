Compiling

Encryption is the hiding plain text with a cipher.
Decrypting is returning text to readable form.

compiler turns machine code to source code, and visa versa

vscode uses a compiler called clang or c language

Compiling in C involves major steps

First, preprocessing is where the header files in your code are copied and pasted into your file. During this step, the code from cs50.h is copied into your program.

Second, compiling is where your program is converted into assembly code.

Third, assembling involves the compiler converting your assembly code into machine code.

Finally, during the linking step, code from your included libraries are also converted into machine code and combined with your code. The final executable file is then outputted.

Debugging

mistakes in coding

debugger is a tool that helps programmers track code.

Arrays

Each data type requires a certain amount of system resources:
bool 1 byte
int 4 bytes
long 8 bytes
float 4 bytes
double 8 bytes
char 1 byte
string ? bytes

Strings
String - an array characters

Command-Line Arguments

Command-line arguments - arguments that are passed to your program at the command line.

Exit status

When a program ends, a special exit code is provided to the computer

When a program exits without error, a status code of 0 is provided the computer. Often, when an error occurs that results in the program ending, a status of 1 is provided by the computer.
