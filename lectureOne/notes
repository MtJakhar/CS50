Lecture One.

Source code-code that humans write like C, javascript..
Machine code- binary, computer commands
Compiler- program which translates one language to another ex source to machine
Visual studio code is a Compiler

In Terminal if you do:
code- is a vscode cmd

code (filename.language)- you create a new file in your directory with those parameters

make (filename)- converts source code to machine code, so that it is executable in the terminal.

./(filename)- runs file or directory

Escape sequence- a way to tell the computer that a certain character has a special meaning, like a quotation mark or a new line, so it knows how to handle it correctly within the code.

\" – double quote
\\ – single backslash
\a – bell/alert
\b – backspace
\r – carriage return
\n – newline
\s – space
\t – tab

Functions- are algorithms or step by step instructions for solving problems

return value- result of functions

arguments,parameters- are inputs to functions

pure functions have no side effects

side effects- change that is caused by a function beside getting the result

semicolon- every command must end in semicolon, like period for sentence

C lexicon
#include <filename>- tells you to include this file in the code. like react import where you use function and data in those files, in the current file you are working on.

header file- a file that ends in .h, gives you access to the code.

stdio- means standard input and output of keyboard.

library- code that someone else wrote, that you can use.

Manual Pages- aka documentation

Variables
hello.c is used in examples

variable- a thing which stores a value.
data types- in c, we must declare the type of the variable. such as int, bool, char, string, etc...

%s- placeholder for format code. tells printf to prepare to receive a string.

format code- %c, %f, %i, %li, %s. %s is used for string variables, %i is used for int variables. More in Docs.

incrementing, decrementing
int counter = 0;

to increment by one
counter = counter + 1; || counter += 1; || counter++;

to decrement by one
counter = counter - 1; || counter -= 1; || counter--;

Conditionals

in order to do conditionals you must use if/else/else_if , statements.

ex:
if(x > y){
"do something"
} else if{
"do something else"
} else {
"otherwise do this"
}

flow charts- area way by which you can examine how a program functions. used to examine efficiency of our code

Loops

For Loop:

A for loop is used when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat a block of code.

It has three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

Syntax:

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
// code to be repeated
}

While Loop:

A while loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true.

It checks the condition before executing the code block, which means the code may not run at all if the condition is false initially.
Syntax:

while (condition) {
// code to be repeated
}

creating funtions

void meow(void)
{
printf("meow\n");
}

The initial void means that the function does not return any values. The (void) means that no values are being provided to the function

look at meow.c for more on function ex.

Operators and Abstraction

Operators- mathematical operations

-   for addition

*   for subtraction

-   for multiplication
    / for division
    % for remainder/modelo

Abstraction/"Abstract away"- simplifying our code such that it deals with smaller and smaller problems, aka refactor

look at calculator c for more examples of operators and use of abstraction

Linux and the Command Line

Linux- operating system that is accessible via the command line in the terminal window in VS Code.

Some common command-line arguments we may use include:
cd, for changing our current directory (folder)
cp, for copying files and directories
ls, for listing files in a directory
mkdir, for making a directory
mv, for moving (renaming) files and directories
rm, for removing (deleting) files
rmdir, for removing (deleting) directories

Types

Types refer to the possible data that can be stored within a variable. For example, a char is designed to accommodate a single character like a or 2.

Types are very important because each type has specific limits.
For example, because of the limits in memory, the highest value of an int can be 4294967295. If you attempt to count an int higher, integer overflow will result where an incorrect value will be stored in this variable.

some types in C

bool, a Boolean expression of either true or false
char, a single character like a or 2
double, a floating-point value with more digits than a float
float, a floating-point value, or real number with a decimal value
int, integers up to a certain size, or number of bits
long, integers with more bits, so they can count higher than an int
string, a string of characters
