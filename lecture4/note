Lecture 4 Memory

Pixel Art

Pixels are squares, dots, of color that are arranged on an up-down, left-right grid.

RGB- red, green, blue, represented by 3 squential numbers in the same order 255,255,255.

Hexadecimal

Hexadecimal- is a system of counting that has 16 counting values. they are as follows:
0123456789abcdef
f represents 15

Hexadecimal is also known as base-16.
When counting in hexadecimal, each column is a power of 16.
The number 0 is represented as 00.
The number 1 is represented as 01.
The number 9 is represented by 09.
The number 10 is represented as 0A.
The number 15 is represented as 0F.
The number 16 is represented as 10.
The number 255 is represented as FF, because 16 x 15 (or F) is 240. Add 15 more to make 255. This is the highest number you can count using a two-digit hexadecimal system.
Hexadecimal is useful because it can be represented using fewer digits. Hexadecimal allows us to represent information more succinctly.

Memory

%p format specifier is used in the printf() function to format and print a pointer's value.

Pointers

Pointer is a variable that contains the address of some value. An address in your computer's memory.

look at addresses.c

you can think of pointer as one address that points to another.

Strings

string is an array of characters.

char \*s = "HI!";
is the C way of doing,
string s = "HI!";
this is cs50.h extension

Pointer Arithmetic

look at addresses.c

String Comparison

A string of characters is simply an array of characters identified by it first byte.

with integers you can use == to compare them, but using == with strings will compare their memory locations. so we must use strcmp, meaning "string compare", to comapte both strings.
