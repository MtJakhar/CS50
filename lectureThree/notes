Lecture 3 Algorithms

Algorithm- steps taken to solve a problem

Linear Search

Linear search is a simple algorithm that sequentially checks each element of a list or array until a match is found or the entire list is traversed, with a time complexity of O(n).

Binary Search

Binary search is a fast search algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target element is found or the search interval is empty, with a time complexity of O(log n).

Running Time

Running time of an algorithm is the amount of time it takes to execute, typically denoted using BigO notation to describe its growth rate relative to the input size

Data Structures

In C we can create our own datatypes via struct.
for to phonebook.c for example

Sorting

Sorting-the act of taking an unsorted list of values and transforming this list into a sorted one

binary search can be used on sorted lists

many different sorting algorithms.

Selection sort is an example of a sorting algorithm.

the algorithm for selection sort is:
For i from 0 to nâ€“1
Find smallest number between numbers[i] and numbers[n-1]
Swap smallest number with numbers[i]

Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is another sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping elements to "bubble" larger elements to the end.
the algorithm for bubble is

Repeat n-1 times
For i from 0 to n-2
If numbers[i] and numbers[I+1] out of order
Swap them
If no Swaps
Quit

Recursion

Recursion is a concept where a function calls itself.

pseudocode example:

1 Pick up phone book
2 Open to middle of phone book
3 Look at page
4 If person is on page
5 Call person
6 Else if person is earlier in book
7 Search left half of book
9 Else if person is later in book
10 Search right half of book
12 Else
13 Quit

Merge Sort

Merge sort is a sorting algorithm which sorts using recursion

the pseudocode is as follows
If only one number
Quit
Else
Sort left half of number
Sort right half of number
Merge sorted halves
